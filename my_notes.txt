Components is a piece of code that we can reuse.
2 types of component
- Class Component
- Functional Component


Class Component

- What is class component?
Start with class keyword, we can use constructor, functions within classes.
Class component is a stateful component, we can use state only with CC. 

- When to use?
If we need some data to be changed like form input data modification..

------------------------------

Functional Component

- FC is a statless component.
- We can not use state in FC, for this we need to use hooks in FC 
- If we only want to display data then we will use FC

Benifits?
- we write Less code.(no constructor,no render etc)
- we can not use this keyword with FC, (so no need to bind or write this keyword.)
- 

----------------------------------

JSX

JSX is a javascript xml. it allows us to write html in javascript

---------------------------------

Props

What is Props
- When we write function and we pass some parameters to function, props is like that, if we want to pass/get data to component we use props.
We use props when we want to pass data among multiple components, eg pass data from parent component to child component.

Props with FC

pass from app.js to component <Testfuncomp info={{name:'Nilesh', age:'28'}} data='Joshi' />
fetched in component like , {props.info.name} {props.data}


Props with CC

pass from app.js to component like, <Testclasscomp info={{name:'Nilesh', age:'28'}} data='Joshi' />
fetched in component like , <p> {this.props.info.name} {this.props.data} </p>

-----------------------------------

State

What is state

state is a internal object of a class, which is private object(it can not access outside class).
It's a kind of variable that we create and add value to it and pass anywhere in prog lang.
it's a key value pair and we can use it anywhere
state is changable




Example check Teststate.js file for detailed desc

update state on button click
